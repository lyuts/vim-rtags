# Vim Rtags

Vim bindings for rtags.

https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags

# Requirements

# Installation
## Vundle
Add the following line to ```.vimrc```

    Plugin 'lyuts/vim-rtags'

then while in vim run:

    :source %
    :PluginInstall

## NeoBundle
Add the following line to ```.vimrc```

    NeoBundle 'lyuts/vim-rtags'

then while in vim run:

    :source %
    :NeoBundleInstall

## Pathogen
    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone https://github.com/lyuts/vim-rtags

# Configuration
This plugin interacts with RTags by invoking ```rc``` commands and interpreting
their results.  You can override the path to ```rc``` binary by setting
```g:rtagsRcCmd``` variable.  By default, it is set to ```rc```, expecting it to be
found in the $PATH.

Out of box this plugin provides mappings. In order to use custom mappings the
default mappings can be disabled:

    let g:rtagsUseDefaultMappings = 0

By default, search results are showed in a location list. Location lists
are local to the current window. To use the vim QuickFix window, which is
shared between all windows, set:

    let g:rtagsUseLocationList = 0

To implement 'return to previous location after jump' feature, internal stack is used.
It is possible to set its maximum size (number of entries), default is 100:

    let g:rtagsJumpStackMaxSize = 100

## Unite sources

This plugin defines three Unite sources:
* `rtags/references` - list references (i.e., &lt;Leader&gt;rf).
* `rtags/symbol` - find symbol (i.e., &lt;Leader&gt;rs). Use `rtags/symbol:i`
  for case insensitive search.
* `rtags/project` - list/switch projects.

## Code completion
Code completion functionality uses ```completefunc``` (i.e. CTRL-X CTRL-U). If ```completefunc```
is set, vim-rtags will not override it with ```RtagsCompleteFunc```. This functionality is still
unstable, but if you want to try it you will have to set ```completefunc``` by

    set completefunc=RtagsCompleteFunc

Also ```RtagsCompleteFunc``` can be used as omnifunc. For example, you can use
such approach with [neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim)(for more details read it's docs):

```
function! SetupNeocompleteForCppWithRtags()
    " Enable heavy omni completion.
    setlocal omnifunc=RtagsCompleteFunc

    if !exists('g:neocomplete#sources#omni#input_patterns')
        let g:neocomplete#sources#omni#input_patterns = {}
    endif
    let l:cpp_patterns='[^.[:digit:] *\t]\%(\.\|->\)\|\h\w*::'
    let g:neocomplete#sources#omni#input_patterns.cpp = l:cpp_patterns 
    set completeopt+=longest,menuone
endfunction

autocmd FileType cpp,c call SetupNeocompleteForCppWithRtags()

```
Such config provides automatic calls, of omnicompletion on c and cpp entity accessors.

### Current limitations
* There is no support for overridden functions and methods
* Thre is no support for function argument completion

# Notes
1. This plugin is wip.

# Development
Unit tests for some plugin functions can be found in ```tests``` directory.
To run tests, execute:

    $ vim tests/test_rtags.vim +UnitTest
